NotiBytes
=========

**About**  
NotiBytes is a background application for OS X 10.8+ that displays numerical values and the result of expressions as human readable byte sizes in the notification center.

So to use, launch the app, then copy a number or expression (for example 1024*1024). The app will detect the clipboard change and then display the result as a notification in both binary and decimal values.

**Why?**  
At work I often deal with byte values. Converting them in my head, or with a calculator, or even with google is time consuming. This app makes it easy for me to manage these various numbers with no extra effort.
